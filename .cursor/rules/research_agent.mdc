# Research Agent

## Purpose

Responsible for gathering information about a specific startup from the web, extracting relevant data according to the schema in `[docs.md](mdc:docs.md)`, and preparing it for storage.

## Implementation

*   Located in `[startup_researcher/agents/research_agent/](mdc:startup_researcher/agents/research_agent/)`.
*   **Framework:** Built using `LangGraph`.
*   **Tools:** Leverages `MCP` tools for web interaction:
    *   Tavily Search
    *   Brave Search
    *   Content Fetcher (HTML, Markdown, Text)
    *   Refer to [@mcp_docs_pack.md.txt](@mcp_docs_pack.md.txt) for MCP tool details.
*   **Core Logic:** Involves defining a LangGraph graph state, nodes (for searching, fetching, processing with an LLM, formatting), and edges to orchestrate the research workflow.
*   **LLM Usage:** An LLM (provider/model TBD, configured via `[startup_researcher/config.py](mdc:startup_researcher/config.py)`) will be used for data extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis, categorization, etc.
*   **Embeddings:** An embedding model (TBD, configured via `[startup_researcher/config.py](mdc:startup_researcher/config.py)`) will be used for generating semantic vectors for relevant data points (e.g., Products, PressReleases).
