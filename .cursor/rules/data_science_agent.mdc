# Data Science Agent (Chat with Data)

## Purpose

Provides a conversational interface (`Chainlit`) for users to query the researched startup data stored in the SQLite database and perform data analysis tasks.

## Implementation

*   Located in `[startup_researcher/agents/data_agent/](mdc:startup_researcher/agents/data_agent/)`.
*   **Framework:** Built using `LangGraph`.
*   **UI:** Integrates with `Chainlit`. See [@chainlit_docs_pack.md.txt](@chainlit_docs_pack.md.txt).
*   **Database Interaction:**
    *   Interacts with the SQLite database.
    *   May use an `MCP` SQLite tool (if available/suitable - see [@mcp_docs_pack.md.txt](@mcp_docs_pack.md.txt)) or generate SQL queries to be executed via SQLAlchemy/SQLModel.
*   **Core Logic:** Involves a LangGraph graph handling user messages, planning queries, interacting with the database, performing analysis (potentially using `pandas`, plotting libraries), and formatting results for the Chainlit UI.
*   **Query Handling:** Needs a mechanism (likely LLM-based within the LangGraph) to translate natural language questions into database queries or analysis steps.
